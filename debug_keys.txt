		During the creation of the first layer of a pure metal, a unit cell has been created and the top left atom	
		of the next cell has been initialised
	1002 
		During the repeat layer function, a a layer has been created and added to the layer list and the current layer 	variable has been initialised.
	1003 
		During the convert_to_atom_position_list function, a cell's atom posiotns have been added to the atom position list. Duplicate entries for atom positions have been removed. 
	1004 
		During the populate_dataframe function, an atom with its corresponding atom name, position, status and initial values for for force and velocity is added as a row to the dataframe_rows dict. 
	1005
